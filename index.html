        <h1>Missile Man Of India</h1>
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil 
            Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in 
            the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father 
            Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother
             Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims 
             back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.

            Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His 
            ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous 
            properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found 
            in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and 
            local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the 
            mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims
             between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the 
             mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and 
             properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family 
             was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell
              newspapers to add to the family's meager income. 
            
            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and
             hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his 
             studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his education at 
             Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the
              St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 
              1954.
            
            Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras 
            Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project,
             the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke 
             his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. 
             Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was 
             putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He 
             narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
              ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
